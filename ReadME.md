# Vacations Site

The project describes the development of a **Vacation Tagging System**, where each user can browse available vacations and mark them with a **Follow** tag. Any vacation followed by a user will be tracked for updates, and whenever the **admin** makes changes (such as updating dates, prices, or status), the modifications are saved in the **database (DB)** and reflected for all users who follow that vacation. The system provides a simple user experience with browsing, following, and receiving real-time updates based on administrative changes.
